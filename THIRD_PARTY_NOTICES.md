## HandBrake / HandBrakeCLI

- Component: HandBrakeCLI

- Source: https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake
- Current SwiftRipTools target version: 1.11.1
- License: GNU General Public License version 2
- Use in SwiftRipTools: built as the command-line ripping/transcoding engine consumed by SwiftRip.app.

## libdvdcss

- Component: libdvdcss

- Source: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libdvdcss
- Current SwiftRipTools target version: 1.5.0
- License: GNU General Public License
- Use in SwiftRipTools: built as an app-local dynamic library so SwiftRip.app does not rely on Homebrew, MacPorts, `/usr/local/lib`, `/opt/local/lib`, or other user-installed runtime libraries.

libdvdcss is not authored by the SwiftRip project. libdvdcss remains under the copyright and license notices of the VideoLAN project and its contributors.

## Build Tools

SwiftRipTools may use developer-installed build tools such as:

- clang / Xcode command-line tools
- Meson
- Ninja
- Git
- curl
- tar
- lipo
- install_name_tool
- codesign

These tools are used to build artifacts during development. They are not intended to be runtime dependencies of SwiftRip.app.

## Runtime Dependency Rule

SwiftRip.app should not require users to install HandBrake, libdvdcss, Homebrew, MacPorts, or other external runtime packages.

The intended app bundle model is:

```text
SwiftRip.app/
  Contents/
    MacOS/
      SwiftRip
      HandBrakeCLI
    Frameworks/
      libdvdcss.2.dylib
    Resources/
      SwiftRip.json
```

The bundled tools and libraries should be signed together with the app before distribution.
