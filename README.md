# SwiftRipTools

SwiftRipTools is the separate build/package workspace for the command-line tools used by SwiftRip.app.

Its job is to produce known-good, signed, app-bundled artifacts such as:

- HandBrakeCLI
- libdvdcss.2.dylib
- any required runtime support files

SwiftRip.app should consume finished artifacts from this workspace rather than relying on Homebrew, MacPorts, /usr/local/lib, or manually installed tools.

## Contributor bootstrap

Generated tool artifacts are intentionally not committed to Git. On a clean checkout, prepare them with:

```sh
SwiftRipTools/Scripts/bootstrap-tools.zsh
```

The bootstrap script first verifies any existing local artifacts. If they are missing or invalid, it tries to download the pinned tool package from `SwiftRipTools/Manifest/swiftrip-tools.json`. If the package is unavailable, it falls back to building the tools locally:

- `SwiftRipTools/Artifacts/macos-arm64/HandBrakeCLI`
- `SwiftRipTools/Artifacts/macos-arm64/libdvdcss.2.dylib`

Force a rebuild with:

```sh
SwiftRipTools/Scripts/bootstrap-tools.zsh --force
```

## HandBrake patching

SwiftRip does not fork HandBrake. App-specific changes are tracked as patch files under:

```text
SwiftRipTools/Patches/HandBrake/
```

`build-handbrakecli.zsh` copies those patches into the extracted HandBrake source before each build. The current `libdvdread` patch makes HandBrake load `libdvdcss.2.dylib` from:

```text
@executable_path/../Frameworks/libdvdcss.2.dylib
```

That matches SwiftRip.app's bundle layout and avoids relying on `/usr/local/lib`.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
SwiftRipTools/Scripts/verify-swiftrip-tools.zsh
```

Verification checks that the generated artifacts are ARM64, do not link against `/opt/local`, and that `HandBrakeCLI` contains the app-bundle `libdvdcss` loader path instead of the legacy `/usr/local/lib/libdvdcss.2.dylib` fallback.

## Packaging

After a successful local rebuild, create the downloadable tool package with:

```sh
SwiftRipTools/Scripts/package-swiftrip-tools.zsh
```

Publish the generated file from `SwiftRipTools/Packages/` to the GitHub release URL recorded in `SwiftRipTools/Manifest/swiftrip-tools.json`. CI verifies the manifest checksum before extracting the tools and running the full bundle integrity tests.
